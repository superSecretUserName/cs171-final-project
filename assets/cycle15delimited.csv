Applying knowledge gained from studying cometary X-ray emission, Chandra ACIS-S photometric imaging of X-rays produced by CXE between the solar wind and Pluto's atmosphere will address both the run of atmospheric density and the interaction of the solar wind with the extended Plu tonian atmosphere. Determining the atmosphere's extent and amount of free molecular escape will aid the atmospheric sounding measurements of the NH ALICE instr ument, while determining the x-ray luminosity will help the NH PEPSI instrument characterize the solar wind particle environment. $&              35.000000 $&   McNutt, Jr.                                        $&   Ralph                                    $& 283.072500 $&               0.995556 $&                12.000000 $&         14476 $& WR 122

$&   15200114             $&         14476 $& We propose Chandra ACIS observations of NaSt1 (aka WR 122). NaSt1 is the only candidate analog to the famous colliding-wind X-ray binary Eta Carina. It is an evolved, luminous, hot star that, like Eta Car, is embedded in a dense CNO-processed outflow. We have already secured HST observations of NaSt1 to deter mine the precise morphology of its nebula. Now, we require high-resolution X-ray imaging observations with Chandra/ACIS to determine if, like Eta Car, NaSt1 is an X-ray source, and moreover, a colliding-wind binary. The combined HST and Chandra data will reveal whether NaSt1 is truly an Eta Car analog, or something e ntirely different. $&              12.000000 $&   Mauerhan                                           $&   Jon                                      $& 114.825417 $&               5.225000 $&                95.000000 $&         14518 $& Procyon

The temperat ure-sensitive ratio of the intensity of the Fe lines observed with the HETGS will be compared to the Fe lines observed with LETGS near 100 A to reevaluate a pu zzling discrepancy between theory and observation noted in the spectra of Capella. The observation will also provide a temperature of Procyon's corona using a novel dielectronic satellite method and show that future missions require not only a high effective area but also high spectral resolution to use this method. $&              95.000000 $&   Beiersdorfer                                       $&   Peter                                    $& 153.953750 $&               9.780500 $&                16.100000 $&         14596 $& SDSS J101548.90+094649.7

$&   15200243             $&         14596 $& Carbon stars (C>O) were long assumed to all be giants, because only AGB stars dredge up significant carbon into their atmospheres. We now know that dwa rf carbon (dC) stars are actually far more common than C giants. These dCs are hypothesized to have accreted C-rich envelope material from an AGB companion, in systems that have likely undergone a planetary nebula phase, eventually yielding a white dwarf and a dC that has gained both significant mass and angular mome ntum. To test whether the X-ray emission strength and spectral properties are consistent with a rejuvenated dynamo, we propose a Chandra pilot study of dCs sel ected from the SDSS; some have hot white dwarf companions (indicating more recent mass transfer), and all show Balmer emission lines (a sign of activity). $&              16.100000 $&   Green                                              $&   Paul                                     $& 235.597500 $&             -52.386000 $&                80.000000 $&         14682 $& QV Nor

The goal is to put observational constrains on the current models of stellar winds in massiv e stars using the point like source of ionizing X-rays as a probe. In particular we want to: a) characterize the rich emission line spectrum suggested by XMM, obtaining the first high resolution spectrum ever for this source. b) study the ionized wind of QV Nor in the innermost region r< 1.5R* which, to date, remains largely unexplored, c) finally, study the interstellar medium and the poorly known distance towards QV Nor by analyzing the properties of the dust scattered h alo. $&              80.000000 $&   Torrejon                                           $&   Jose                                     $& 162.314583 $&             -53.318361 $&                50.000000 $&         14699 $& WISE1049-5319

To date only one L dwarf, Kelu1, has been detected at X-rays. The very recent discovery of WISE1049-5319, a brown dwarf binary at only 2pc from the Sun and the third-closest neighbor of the Sun, presents the opportunity to perform the deepest possible X-ray observations for an ultracoo l dwarf. A 50ksec Chandra observation allows us to move even beyond the sensitivity limits achieved for the (X-ray) brighter M dwarfs. The X-ray detection of W ISE1049-5319 would represent a major step in our knowledge of magnetic activity in the substellar regime. A strong constraint on the upper limit would also be important. $&              50.000000 $&   Stelzer                                            $&   Beate                                    $& 134.773333 $&             -47.511361 $&               135.000000 $&         14770 $& RCW38/IRS2

$&   15200448             $&         14791 $& Young stars are born surrounded by primordial disks. Eventually, these proto-planetary disks vanish. Some systems later form a debris disk with small d ust grains. Up until May 2008 our target TYC 8241 2652 1 showed strong IR emission from such a disk. Between 2008 and 2010 the IR emission dropped by two order s of magnitude, which means that the dust mass in the inner disk decreased by 90-99%. The cause is unknown, but several hypotheses require high X-ray activity. We propose to observe this target for 10 ks with ACIS-S. This pointing will verify the association of a close-by ROSAT and XMM-Newton slew survey source with TYC 8241 2652 1, confirm the X-ray flux and look for signatures of high X-ray activity such as high plasma temperatures and Ne/Fe abundance ratios. $&              10.000000 $&   Guenther                                           $&   Hans                                     $& 115.285417 $&              20.428972 $&                10.000000 $&         14818 $& Y Gem

Other recent works have shown an abundance of small rocky planets in very close orbits around their hos t stars, suggesting that the stellar high-energy irradiation evaporates away gaseous envelopes. KOI-314 is the first nearby system in which earth-sized planets of both types are detected, allowing us to constrain the efficiency of planetary evaporation if the stellar X-ray irradiation is measured. We therefore propos e a 10 ks Chandra ACIS-S pointing to determine the stellar X-ray luminosity and hardness ratio.

In the latter case, the 18 minute perio d would be either the spin period of a magnetic white dwarf in an intermediate polar cataclysmic variable or the orbital period of a double-degenerate AM CVn b inary.

In our previous 270-ks full-frame ACIS-S observation, X7 suffered from significant pile-up (~15%), degrading the spectr um and introducing large statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurement. We propose a 200-ks 1/8 subarray ACIS-S exposure in order to minimize the deleterious effects of pile-up, thereby dramatically improving the constraints on the structure of this NS and yielding the best such measurement for any qLMX B. $&             200.000000 $&   BOGDANOV                                           $&   SLAVKO                                   $& 256.557500 $&             -61.729083 $&               100.000000 $&         14517 $& IGR J17062-6143

If the rapid changes result from interaction with a n accretion disk wind, then we predict that all Doppler shift changes are abrupt, that the jets will shift independently, and that the Doppler shifts would onl y follow the known periods in a general way. We will test this model with 150 ks of HETGS data and joint VLBA data, so two knot ejections are expected in both jets.

These observations will a llow us to place new constraints on accretion flows and their outflows deep in quiescence, and to break some degeneracies between different accretion models. $&              26.000000 $&   Plotkin                                            $&   Richard                                  $& 186.327500 $&              14.762694 $&                60.000000 $&         14813 $& CXOU J122518.6+144545

$&   15400471             $&         14813 $& In 2010 we reported the discovery of CXOU J122518.6+144545. A new Chandra observation in 2012 showed that it varies by more than a factor 10 in X-ray f lux. This leaves us with two options: we either discovered a rare type IIn SN, or the second most luminous HLX thus far. Deeper Chandra observations combined w ith a new HST visit will decide between these scenarios. If CXO J1225 was a supernova, with these new data we will be able to identify the progenitor star. Thi s will be only the second type IIn SN for which this is done. If instead the source is an HLX it is a strong candidate to contain an intermediate mass black ho le. In this case the new Chandra data will give us information about its variability and the HST image will give us stronger constraints on the size of the opt ical source. $&              60.000000 $&   Heida                                              $&   Marianne                                 $& 259.122917 $&             -38.040000 $&                 5.000000 $&         14857 $& IGR J17164-3803

It would be only the second SyXB with a carbon star, and the first based o n a secure X-ray detection.

Using Chandra and XMM-Newton we have fo llowed in unprecedented detail the cooling of the neutron star transient XTE J1701-462, which accreted at super- and near-Eddington rates for 1.6 years before returning to quiescence. A recent observation indicates that the source has now entered a phase of more rapid cooling after an extended period of much slower e volution. Here we propose to continue our successful monitoring of the source with a 115 ks observation early in Cycle 15, thus extending our tracking of the s ource from 5.2 to 6.5 years into quiescence. This will serve to constrain the current phase of rapid cooling and thereby the properties of the neutron star inn er crust. $&             115.000000 $&   Homan                                              $&   Jeroen                                   $& 5.121250 $&              59.281083 $&               150.000000 $&         15213 $& IC 10 X-1

$&   15400871             $&         15213 $& IC 10 X-1 shattered all mass records for stellar black holes. The fact that it eclipses significantly constrains its inclination and its distance is kn own because it resides in IC 10. These three quantities, mass, inclination and distance, are the key input parameters needed to derive spin from the thermal sp ectrum of a black hole. However, at a flux of 0.1 mCrab, we are stymied by a lack of signal at the highest energies, which prevents us from measuring its spin. Only through a coordinated effort combining NuSTAR's high energy sensitivity and Chandra pristine optics and low energy sensitivity can this be done.

That outburst lasted ~6 months, and since it has remained in quiescence. Recently a coordinated effort by Swift, MAXI and Fermi confirmed GRO J1744-28 to be in its first outburst in ~18 years. With Chandra we entered the era of high resolution X-ray spectra, however Chandra has only observed GRO J1744-28 in quiescence, obtaining a very poo r spectrum. ASCA observations (Nishiuchi et al., 1999) detected a 6.7 keV Iron line feature, which is strongly detected in new observations by Swift. However, the poor spectral resolution of ASCA and XRT do not allow us to discern the real nature of this feature. With such high accretion rate, we might expect that th e line complex is a blend of neutral and high ionized lines from disk wind. Only Chandra HETG observations have the sufficient resolution to pin down the natur e of the X-ray emission lines in GRO J1744-28. $&              10.000000 $&   Kennea                                             $&   Jamie                                    $& 266.137917 $&             -28.740833 $&                70.000000 $&         16188 $& GRO J1744-28

The complex is e ither due to a very odd combination of charge states within cospatial gas, or it represents double-horned emission line structure from a truncated accretion di sk. This is a significant challenge to basic ideas of accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries, HETG resolution can solve it.

$&   15500072             $&         14433 $& Calvera is a 59 ms X-ray pulsar at high Galactic latitude that was selected from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The absence of a PWN, radio, or gamma-ray em ission, suggested that Calvera is a passively cooling NS and a nearby candidate for the elusive descendants of the central compact objects (an orphaned CCO). W e recently measured the spin-down rate of Calvera, which, on the contrary, shows that it is surprisingly energetic. This makes it very difficult to understand its location and relative silence. In any scenario for Calvera's birth, whether in the Galactic disk or halo, its proper motion vector could be large and easil y measured by Chandra, which will shed light on its origin. Deep optical images will help determine its distance and emission mechanisms. $&              30.000000 $&   Halpern                                            $&   Jules                                    $& 125.488750 $&             -43.004806 $&                99.000000 $&         14452 $& PSR J0821-4300

$&   15500090             $&         14452 $& We detected spin-down of the pulsar in Puppis A, which requires a dipole magnetic field of only 2.8e10 G, the smallest of any young neutron star. This confirms the anti-magnetar scenario for CCOs. PSR J0821-4300 also has an X-ray spectral feature that is either an emission line at 0.75 keV or an absorption li ne at 0.46 keV, which is consistent with an electron cyclotron resonance at roughly the spin-down magnetic field strength. We propose to extend the time span o f the ephemeris from 3 years to 15 years by linking new and archival data, measuring the spin-down rate to 0.1 percent and seeing if it is stable over this tim e span. This will test for any torque noise due to accretion of supernova ejecta, which is the most plausible mechanism for generating an emission line in the spectrum. $&              99.000000 $&   Halpern                                            $&   Jules                                    $& 83.866667 $&             -69.269750 $&                75.000000 $&         14511 $& SN 1987A

This begs the question of how low the true magnetic field distribution of magn etars stretches and whether it is in fact distinct from that of the main pulsar population. Here we propose to perform phase-coherent timing of Swift J1822.3-1 606 with Chandra.

We propose a new epoch of imaging of Tycho's SNR, with the goal of expanding the baseline for proper motions to as many as 14 years. In a recent work, we have shown that the ISM surrounding Tycho is non-uniform, in agreement with the limited proper motion studies that have been done in radio and X-rays. The dynamics of the for ward shock can be used to localize the explosion site. A new epoch will also allow the first ever study of ejecta dynamics in a Type Ia SNR, including the prop er motion of individual elements, which reflect the ejecta structure at the time of explosion and can distinguish between various explosion models for Type Ia SNe. $&             150.000000 $&   Williams                                           $&   Brian                                    $& 60.820417 $&              71.721917 $&                30.000000 $&         15075 $& SN 2005kd

SN 2005kd appeared to be fading most rapidly, b ut then brightened again last year, leading to a very interesting evolution. SN 2006jd has a reasonably well-sampled light curve, although the high-temperature spectrum has been difficult to constrain. Coupling this spectrum with previous data, and hydrodynamical simulations, we will model the evolution of the X-ray emission, use it to place limits on the ambient medium density, and thereby the SN progenitor, providing clues to the progenitors of Type IIn SNe. $&              30.000000 $&   Dwarkadas                                          $&   Vikram                                   $& 262.671667 $&             -21.492056 $&               150.000000 $&         15109 $& Kepler's Supernova Remnant

$&   15500763             $&         15109 $& The remnant of Kepler's Type Ia SN shows an interaction of SN ejecta with a highly asymmetric ambient circumstellar medium (CSM). This material was eje cted by a single-degenerate progenitor prior to the explosion, and its complex spatial distribution contains invaluable information about the progenitor itself . We propose a third-epoch observation of Kepler's SNR that will provide us with much improved expansion rates, allowing for measurements of shock speeds along the whole periphery of the remnant. These measurements will be compared with 3-D hydrodynamic simulations, thus unraveling the true shape of the CSM in a Type Ia progenitor. They will also advance our knowledge of poorly-understood particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification processes in fast SNR shocks. $&             150.000000 $&   Borkowski                                          $&   Kazimierz                                $& 165.437500 $&             -61.027667 $&               250.000000 $&         15216 $& IGR J11014-6103

$&   15500874             $&         15216 $& IGR J11014-6103 is a unique X-ray emitter comprising: (1) a run-away pulsar with the highest known kick velocity to date, (2) an elongated wind nebula trailing behind it (detected in radio and X-rays), and (3) a collimated jet-like feature extending over 20 parsecs. The peculiar shape and orientation of this feature suggests this could be the most elongated precessing pulsar jet ever detected in our Galaxy. Due to the limited exposure time of the data available so far however two competing scenarios still remain to be investigated. With this proposal, we aim at unveiling the real nature of the jet through a 250 ksec obse rvation of IGR J11014-6103 with Chandra/ACIS-I, fully exploiting the unique high angular resolution and large field-of-view capabilities of this instrument. $&             250.000000 $&   Pavan                                              $&   Lucia                                    $& 148.925417 $&              69.673889 $&                50.000000 $&         15273 $& SN2014J

Type Ia Supernov ae have been employed as cosmic ladders to reveal the accelerating Universe. In spite of their importance for Cosmology, a key, fundamental question still rema in open: Which stars are the progenitors of these cosmic standards? We ask for deep X-ray observations, to probe the environment around SN2014J down to unprece dented limits. By timing the X-ray observations to the time of the optical peak, and using the formalisms I developed in Margutti 2012 (ApJ 751 134) I will be able to probe densities as low as a few d-10 Msun/yr (or a few particle/cm3), thus enabling us to distinguish between symbiotic and double-degenerate progenito rs. These limits would be a factor 10 deeper than the any other limit presented in the literature so far. It is also possible that this study will lead to the first detection of X-ray radiation from a Type Ia SN. $&              50.000000 $&   Margutti                                           $&   Raffaella                                $& 356.385833 $&              -4.823167 $&               100.000000 $&         14719 $& 2MASX J23453268-0449256

We propose to measure the relation between star formation rate and X-ray luminosity in a sample of Lyman break analogs, local galaxies that strongly resemble high-redshift, star-forming galaxies, and test the predicted enhancement in X-ray luminosity.

The best IMBH candidates are hyperluminous off-nuclear X-ray sources (HLX) with L_X >10^41 erg/s, but very few are known. We have found a new HLX candidate L_X ~ 10^43 erg/s, with a possible optical counterpart, at 1" from the host galaxy's centre. We requi re Chandra's supreme spatial resolution to confirm the off-nuclear nature and its association with the optical source. We recently proved that the host galaxy' s central massive black hole is inactive, using Gemini spectra, making it very likely that our candidate is the most luminous off-nuclear IMBH known. $&              60.000000 $&   Lin                                                $&   Dacheng                                  $& 13.722917 $&             -37.684444 $&               130.000000 $&         15092 $& NGC 300

The two new exposur es of NGC~300 will be used to address two broad science goals: we will measure the XRT demographics in NGC~300 and investigate their impact on the XLF down to 5x10^35 erg s^-1, and we will co-add all observations to measure the XLF down to 10^35 erg s^-1.

Its X-ray variability implies the presenc e of an absorber located at the distance of the BLR. The X-ray spectrum is rich in emission lines suggesting the presence of photoionized emitters. We propose to map these circumnuclear emitting/absorbing regions through a deep grating observation with the Chandra-HETG. The main goals of the proposal are: (a) use the unique high spectral resolution to resolve for the first time the Fe K emission line profile and therefore the location of the material, by measuring with hig h precision its centroid energy, FWHM and flux, (b) use the high spectral and spatial resolution of the HETG detectors to map the circum-nuclear photoionized e mitters. $&             200.000000 $&   Braito                                             $&   Valentina                                $& 144.847500 $&              83.257250 $&               200.000000 $&         14724 $& 3C 220.3

This unique system allows accurate estimates of both ste llar and dark mass in the luminous radio galaxy. In addition, the lensing magnification of 7 offers an unprecedented view of the interaction between star forma tion and AGN feedback in a luminous, dusty galaxy at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. Our previous 10ks Chandra observation shows X-ray emission throug hout the system, including the SMG, but with too few counts to identify the origin(s). We propose deeper Chandra and HST observations to (1) locate the X-ray s ources, measure the X-ray properties and independently estimate the bolometric luminosities of both AGN (2) better map the offset between the SMG's UV and dust emission. $&             200.000000 $&   Wilkes                                             $&   Belinda                                  $& 64.588750 $&              38.026611 $&               150.000000 $&         14743 $& 3C 111

$&   15700397             $&         14743 $& X-ray winds are routinely observed in the spectra of Seyfert galaxies. They can be classified as warm absorbers (WAs), with v~100-1,000km/s, and ultra- fast outflows (UFOs), with v>10,000km/s. In stark contrast, the lack of sensitive enough observations allowed the detection of WAs or UFOs only in very few rad io galaxies. Therefore, we propose to observe a small sample of three radio galaxies with the Chandra HETG - 3C111 for 150ks, 3C390.3 for 150ks and 3C120 for 2 00ks - to detect and study in detail their WAs. We will quantify the importance of mechanical feedback from winds in radio galaxies and compare them to the rad io jet power. We will also test whether WAs and UFOs can be unified in a single, multi-phase and multi-scale outflow, as recently reported for Seyferts. $&             500.000000 $&   Tombesi                                            $&   Francesco                                $& 329.280833 $&             -69.687917 $&               190.000000 $&         14762 $& PKS B2152-699-HIC

It also shows strong jet deflections closer to the AGN, apparently associated with highly-ionized gas clouds, where measurements of the X-ray temperature will tell us about energy transfers to the clouds.

$&   15700482             $&         14823 $& Active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence their surroundings via feedback processes and contribute significantly to the evolution of their host galaxies. While this is well established today, AGN feedback has only been observed in high mass galaxies. This raises the question whether AGN feedback is genuinely abs ent in low mass galaxies. Understanding the feedback processes operating in these galaxies is in particular crucial as AGN feedback would have a much higher im pact on their evolution. We therefore propose to observe NGC 1377, a rare low mass galaxy showing indications for AGN activity and feedback, for 50 ks. If conf irmed, this object will be ideal to further constrain the existing galaxy evolution and AGN feedback models. $&              50.000000 $&   Lohfink                                            $&   Anne                                     $& 196.986250 $&               4.371000 $&                70.000000 $&         14826 $& SDSSJ130756.73+042215.57

AG N-driven winds are most directly studied at the spatial scale of the narrow line region (NLR), but little is known of NLR X-ray emitting gas, which may be the dominant component in mass outflows. Given its brightness and orientation, the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 is one of the few AGN for which we can resolve the X-r ay NLR. We will obtain a 250 ksec Chandra/HETG observation, at a roll angle which will permit us to map the kinematics and ionization structure of the high-ion ization gas. We will use these data to determine the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of the X-ray gas, and, thus, its role in AGN feedback. $&             250.000000 $&   Kraemer                                            $&   Steven                                   $& 251.207917 $&              57.583389 $&                50.000000 $&         14849 $& Swift J1644+57

$&   15700595             $&         14935 $& Mrk 590 is presently in an unusual state. Its soft-excess has disappeared, its broad emission lines have disappeared, and it shows the presence of a re lativistic outflow. All these observations could be related to each other and perhaps the underlying cause is a low accretion rate relative to Eddington. Our p roposed observations with Chandra and HST will not only help to understand the curious case of Mrk 590, but also to answer some long-standing questions in AGN physics: What is the origin of the soft-excess?; What is the origin of the broad emission line region?; What is the launching mechanism of outflows? Mrk 590 pr ovides us with an unique opportunity to find the underlying physics related to these apparently disparate phenomena. $&              70.000000 $&   Mathur                                             $&   Smita                                    $& 123.380417 $&              25.750833 $&               100.000000 $&         15022 $& HS 0810+2554

We see remarkable X-ray structure: arcsecond-scale cavities apparently associated with the AGN outflows and arcmin-scale features in the X-ray halo that may be cold fronts or shocks associated with recent merger activity. We propose an ACIS exposure that will allow a spectroscopic study of these features and a characterization of the temperature, density, pressure and entropy profiles of the intergalactic medium surrounding the bright central galaxy. These data will give important insight into the history of this as yet unmerged SuperMassive Binary Black Hole and its feedback on the X-ray halo. $&             100.000000 $&   Romani                                             $&   Roger                                    $& 214.090000 $&              23.090528 $&                 5.000000 $&         14664 $& RXJ1416.4+2315 Offset 2

It is also unusually relaxed providing a special opportunity to study its mass profile by applying hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the still debated issue of very high concentrations found for some massive lensing clusters, by obtaining high quality X-ray data for a well relaxed cluster we will per form a key test for the Lambda CDM structure formation scenario. $&              51.000000 $&   Gastaldello                                        $&   Fabio                                    $& 41.365417 $&             -53.036111 $&               180.000000 $&         14681 $& Abell S0295

$&   15800369             $&         14715 $& The classic picture of merger-driven shocks creating cluster peripheral radio re lics is in trouble. Abell 2256 presents unique challenges to shock-dri ven models, exacerbating issues in the recent literature. It also provides the only opportunity to probe instabilities in the shock plane, because of the orien tation of its spectacular filamentary relic. We have identified a possible thermal shock associated with the relic, but the canonical bright radio edge is miss ing. We have also found a unique structure where a tailed radio galaxy has apparently punched through a cold front. For a variety of fundamental cluster physic s questions related to the interaction of thermal and relativistic plasmas, Abell 2256, with this proposed set of deep Chandra observations, alone holds the ke y. $&             180.000000 $&   RUDNICK                                            $&   LAWRENCE                                 $& 232.855833 $&              35.561167 $&               110.000000 $&         14785 $& 3C320

We propose to observe these for long enough to test shock models (including the results of numerical modeling) and establish the energetic input to the clust er by the radio galaxies.

We propose 4 Chandra snapshots to detect all the bright point sources in the outskirt of the most luminous local galaxy group UGC 03957 to obtain a careful estimation of the cosmic X-ray background component and determine the phy sical properties (temperature, metallicity and mass profiles) with our 270 ksec Suzaku observations, limited only by the statistical uncertainty. $&              40.000000 $&   Lovisari                                           $&   Lorenzo                                  $& 356.175000 $&             -42.714611 $&                59.100000 $&         14880 $& SPT-CLJ2344-4243

$&   15800543             $&         14880 $& In the core of the Phoenix cluster (SPT-CLJ2344-4243) is the strongest cooling flow on record, with a classical cooling rate of ~2700 Msun/yr. In contr ast to low redshift "cool core clusters", which are converting only ~5% of the predicted cooling into stars, this cluster is experiencing an 800 Msun/yr starbu rst in the central, most-massive galaxy, corresponding to ~30% of the predicted cooling flow. This unique system begs the question: Why isn't AGN feedback prev enting star formation? In order to address this outstanding question, we propose a combined GO+GTO program to search for cavities/bubbles in a deep X-ray image of the Phoenix cluster, allowing us to quantify the balance, or lack thereof, between cooling and feedback, providing a potential explanation for this exotic system. $&              59.100000 $&   McDonald                                           $&   Michael                                  $& 354.127083 $&              21.145972 $&               120.000000 $&         14921 $& Abell 2626

$&   15800582             $&         14921 $& The cool core cluster A2626 has an amazing radio source. The cD IC5338 has 2 nuclei 3" apart. Radio/X-ray jets from the SW nucleus lead to 2 narrow N a nd S radio arcs; these fit the working surfaces of a pair of precessing jets. Recent radio data also show a W arc, and an E edge. We suggest these are due to a nother pair of precessing jets from the NE nucleus. The S0 galaxy IC5337 is merging from the west; the W arc might also be a radio relic due to a merger shock. Our proposed observation will search for a second pair of precessing jets, an X-ray AGN in the NE nucleus, and the interaction of the jets and arcs with the X -ray gas. We will detect a merger shock associated with the W arc and S0 galaxy, if present. A2626 provides a unique test of precessing jets and merging SMBHs. $&             120.000000 $&   Sarazin                                            $&   Craig                                    $& 157.646667 $&              51.542250 $&                20.000000 $&         14956 $& RXJ103035.2+513229

The proposed observations target parameter space that has never been probed by X-ray surveys and will be unequaled fo r decades.
