Today (5/18) Swift confirmed that either the edge-on ADC source AC 211 or the ultracompact (22-min period) M15 X-2 is flaring (L~1.3E37). It is unlikely that AC 211 is responsible as one does not expect t o see bursts from ADC sources. The standard paradigm for ultracompact XRBs like M15 X-2 is that they \"should\" show stable mass transfer. The few Chandra observations of M15 X-2 have not showed significant variations, but today's measured luminosity was 10 times that typically measur ed. The 17-minute ultracompact XRB in NGC 1851 has shown variability by factors of >10 (Maccarone et al. 2010, MNRAS, 406, 2087), a behavior that remains unexplained. Determining that a second ultracompact exhibits large variations would significantly challenge the standard paradigm for accretion in ultracompact XRBs.","x":603.2620875863358,"y":236.78749222308397},{"proposal_number":"12408399","cycle":"12","first":"Tiziana","last":"Di Salvo","time":30,"category":"BH AND NS BINARIES","title":"Chandra spectroscopy of the X-ray spectrum of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17498-2921","type":"DDT","abstract":"Papitto et al.

Reines et al. (2011) have recently discovered a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) in the bulgeless dwarf starburst galaxy Henize 2- 10, offering the first opportunity to study a growing black hole in a nearby galaxy much like those in the earlier universe. Our proposal aims to determine if LLAGN are common in galaxies like Henize 2-10, and to characterize the properties of these local analogues of primordial bla ck hole growth. Using Chandra and the EVLA, we will probe the first radio-selected sample of star-forming blue compact dwarfs for LLAGN, with immediate implications for our understanding of the early stages of galaxy and black hole evolution.","x":10.223186225630343,"y":506.3480256125331},{"proposal_number":"13700570","cycle":"13","first":"Monica","last":"Young","time":77.4,"category":"ACTIVE GALAXIES AND QUASARS","title":"Probing the High End of the Quasar Black Hole Mass Function","type":"GO","abstract":"High-mass (M > 10^9.5 solar masses) supermassive black holes accreting at rates significantly below Eddington (L/L_Edd < 3%) offer a glimpse of the final stage of black hole growth and evolution.

From absorption line spectroscopy, we will achieve significant advances in determing the properties of SMC 13 and provide unique data to constrain new evolutionary calculations of accreting hot white dwarfs. At low m etallicities, the population of SN Ia progenitors shifts toward systems with higher initial WD masses and lower mass donor stars. This difference might turn out to be crucial to understanding the physics of local vs. distant SN Ia.","x":356.91425821278244,"y":350.351694598794},{"proposal_number":"08300829","cycle":"08","first":"Albert","last":"Kong","time":80,"category":"WD BINARIES AND CV","title":"Primordial formation of close binaries in globular clusters with low density cores","type":"GO","abstract":"The primordial binary population is a key input parameter for any realistic model of dense star cluster dynamics.
