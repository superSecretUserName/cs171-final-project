It has demonstrated that even in our immediate astronomical environment surprises may be waiting for being discovered. With their ca rbon and oxygen rich atmospheres and the absence of strong magnetic fields, Venus and Mars represent the closest planetary analogues to comets. Soft X-ray observations provide a sensitive tool to study such atmospheres, in particular any outgassing effects.

There are now a variety of explanations for the emission, from thermal bremsstrahlung of electrons off neutrals or dust, to charge exchange in duced emission from solar wind ions, to reconnection of solar magnetic field lines. In an effort to understand this new phenomenon, we propose spectroscopic and imaging photometric observations with the AXAF ACIS-S of periodic comet P/Tempel 2 during its close approach to Earth in 1 999. Our scientific goal is to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the observed x-rays by producing detailed low energy spectra, high spatial resolution images, hardness maps of the emission.|24.000000|Lisse|Carey

The high accretion rate onto the white dwarfs (WDs) in these binaries allows for steady, rather than explosive burning as in classical novae. The accreted material can therefore remain on the WD, driving its mass closer to the Chandrasekhar limit, rather than being blown off in a nova. OR CAN IT? Classical symbiotics experience outbursts typically every 10 - 20 years, and these events are not well-understood. After the 1985 outburst of the class prototype, Z Andromedae (which is also a 28-minute pulsar), it appeared that a shell of material had been ejected from the WD. This object has recently outburst again. An X-ray observation within roughly one month will provide v, T, and density diagnostics deep wit|20.000000|Charles|Philip

About 60% of the emission is unpulsed and c an be explained by emission from a compact nebula with diameter ~14'', compatible with available radio data. Only AXAF's HRC-I can disentangle the spatial emission, as well as resolve the narrow structures in the lightcurve; a 75 ks observation suffices.

We propose ACIS-S-BI spectroscopy of six such transients in quiescence, to discover whether their luminosity is due to the delayed escape of energ y deposited in the crust during the outburst or to low-level advection-dominated accretion. If accretion is active, we will observe X-ray spectra with a detectable red-shifted oxygen photo-ionization edge. If accretion is not active, then the faint emission is due only to a hot crus t, and we expect spectra which are consistent with a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and no rapid variability.

The elemental abundances and gradients in the hot gas will be derived and compared to the stellar values. If the gas results from local stellar mass loss, the abundances should be similar.

AXAF will be able to resolve the soft emission into point sources, and determine the spectral properties of the brighter LMXBs. Alternatively, if the soft emission is diffuse, the temperature of the warm gas will be determined. If Sa bulge s are lacking an ISM, this implies that galactic winds have driven the gas lost from stars out of the galaxy.

Together, these observations will constrain cosmological cluster models, test the validity of the universal temperature profile to higher redshift, determine the importance of non-thermal pressure support for the X-ray gas, measure iro n abundance distributions and the iron mass in the cluster, detect small scale structure in the cooling core, and determine the radial dependence of the mass deposition rate in the cooling flow.|50.000000|Forman|William

Well-suited for such a shadowing expe riment is the gas-rich, edge-on spiral NGC 4244, which is located in a direction of low Galactic X-ray absorption and is exceptionally inactive in star formation. The proposed ACIS observation of the galaxy will enable us to decompose the soft X-ray background in the 0.2-1 keV range into two separate components: Galactic and extragalactic. This decomposition is particularly important because it may provide a unique diagnosis of the thermal and chemical properties of the hot intergalactic medium.|50.000000|Wang|Q. Daniel

This will be the first-ever detection of an identifiable emission line from the Local Bubble. The O VIII/O VII ratio depends sensitively on the time since the gas was heated by a shock, and therefore determines the age of the Local Bubble. This observation will also help distinguish between models of the ISM dominated by hot or warm gas. If the Local Bubble is young (1e5 yrs) and already large, this suggests the ISM is filled with hot gas. If it is old (>1e6 yrs), then this would suggest bubbles do not break out and do not fill the ISM with hot gas.|100.000000|Smith|Randall

X-ray spectrum, and spatial extensions of the island are consistent with those expected by X-ray irradiation on Sgr B2 from an outside source, hence may be called an X-ray reflection nebula: a new category of X-ray sources. Limited spatial resolution of ASCA, however, prevents us quantitative study on this interesting object. With superior resolving power of AXAF, we propose to study details on it. Main objectives are, (1) make further confirmation that Sgr B2 X-rays are really due to reflection of other X-ray source (s) and make a realistic picture of the reflection, (2) search for star forming activity, and (3) give strong constraint on the irradiating X-ray source(s).|100.000000|Koyama|Katsuji

The proposed AXAF observations of the Arc with ACIS-I will examine the nature of the association between radio filaments and the X-ray gas but also to study if the X-ray counterpart to the synchrotron radio filaments has any nonthermal characteristics in the X-ray. The correlative study between the X-ray and radio images has the potential to provide important clues on the nature of the acceleration of relativistic particles of the nonthermal filaments and on the nature of high energy activity at the Galactic center.|50.000000|Yusef-Zadeh|Farhad

The most controversial issue is if GRXE is truly diffuse emission or composed of numerous point sources. The first imaging observation of GRXE above 2 keV with ASCA could not clearly answer to this question, being limited by the ASCA XRT spatial resolution (HPD~3 arcmin). With AXAF, having much superior spatial resolution, we will be unambiguously give the answer, being able to detect point sources with a luminosity of ~4x10^{32} erg s^{-1} at 10 kpc. If GRXE is truly diffuse emission, the interstellar magnetic reconnection is proposed as a mechanism to heat and confine the hot plasma. We may observe diffuse X-rays distribute along locally intensified magnetic fields, as observed in the Solar flares.|100.000000|Ebisawa|Ken
