It is an evolved, luminous, hot star that, like Eta Car, is embedded in a dense CNO-processed outflow. We have already secured HST observations of NaSt1 to deter mine the precise morphology of its nebula. Now, we require high-resolution X-ray imaging observations with Chandra/ACIS to determine if, like Eta Car, NaSt1 is an X-ray source, and moreover, a colliding-wind binary. The combined HST and Chandra data will reveal whether NaSt1 is truly an Eta Car analog, or something e ntirely different.","approved_exposure_time":"12.000000","approved_time":"12.000000","category_descrip":"STARS AND WD","dec":"0.995556","ra":"283.072500","first":"Jon","last":"Mauerhan","proposal_id":"14476","proposal_number":"15200114","targname":"WR 122","title":"CHANDRA X-RAY OBSERVATIONS OF THE ETA CAR ANALOG NAST1 (WR 122): IS IT A COLLIDING-WIND BINARY?","type":"GO"},"Procyon":{"abstract":"We propose a 95 ksec observation of Procyon with the HETGS, which will provide the first high-resolution stellar observation of the L-shell emission li nes of the M-shell Fe ions, which have been observed before only as absorption features in AGN spectra, such as the HETGS observation of NGC 3783.
